Welcome! How are you!

Meet Limitless – responsive web application kit

Limitless – a new professional admin template, based on Bootstrap framework. Limitless is a powerful and super flexible tool, which suits best for any kind of web application. Includes 1 main and 3 alternative layouts, 1000+ commented HTML pages, 1000+ components with different features and options, 100+ plugins and extensions etc. Limitless includes Starter kit – a set of blank pages, that will make your developer’s life much easier. Limitless template is fully responsive, which means that it looks perfect on mobiles and tablets.

Limitless app kit is fully based on LESS pre-processor, includes 100+ commented LESS files. Each file corresponds to a single component, layout, page, plugin or extension – so you can easily find necessary piece of code and edit it for your needs. The package includes both normal and minified CSS files, compiled from LESS.

Also it is translation ready – you can change application language on-the-fly and use other features such as fallback languages, language detection, direct access etc etc. To see examples, follow the main navigation.

Navigation is a powerful thing here. It supports both collapsible and accordion vertical navigation; multi level horizontal navigation with state saving feature. Horizontal navigation is used in navbars and mega menu. Navbar component has been extended and added plugins and components support (form components, buttons, links, menus, progress bars etc.). Mega menu is another song – it can be any color, any width and include any content.

Page and panel headers support a lot of customization options and can include different components, basically all of them are optional (means you can easily remove them from stylesheets by removing a single line in LESS file).

Overall design is harmonious, clean and user friendly. Even though the template has a lot of content, it doesn’t looks messy and all files and code are well structured, commented and divided. Check out the full list of features and go through all the pages. It will take some time though, but you won’t miss anything. Enjoy!

Please, if you found any bugs or have any suggestions and requests – don’t hesitate to let me know, i will do my best to fix those issues as soon as possible. Support is available: Mon – Fri, 9:00 – 20:00 CET
